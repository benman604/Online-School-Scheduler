# Setup
1. Download and unzip this repository
2. Open the file named index.html in the unzipped folder

# Usage
To edit the your classes and links, click the gear icon and change the meeting name and link under the "Periods" section. 

To edit the join times, you can change all the periods times under different period sequences. The defualts are set to Irvington High School's 2020-2021 schedule. 
Keep in mind the times are in 24-hour format, so you would enter 13 for hour if you have a class at 1:00 pm or 11 if it's at 11:00 am.

You can edit which days of week each sequence is active. Enter the number representing the day of the week (0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.) separated with a comma.

When you are finished, don't forget to scroll down and click "Save Changes" before you close the settings. All changes are saved to your browser local storage.
